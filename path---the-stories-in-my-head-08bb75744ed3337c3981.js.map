So the president headed to him and asked for help. He was desparate, afraid of the passengers to not left pleased. The engineer agreed to fix the engine and asked for 10.000$. The president took the deal even though the price was insane. The engineer headed to the front of the train. Picked up a hammer that was nearby and started looking at the engine. Everyone was waiting and suddenly he makes three hits to three different spots. Big hits. He yield to the driver to turn on the engine and for everyone's surprise the engine was running again. He fixed it. But the president was mad. He turned to the enginneer and said \\\"You charded me 10.000$ just to take three hits with the hammer? I would done it my self!\\\". And the engineer responded \\\"I didn't charged you for the hitting. I charged you because I knew... where to hit.\\\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Amazing. I am always carrying this story in my head. In fact, this story drove me where I am today, always trying to learn things that few people only know. I hope it inspires you too.</p>\\n<p>And here's the second.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A young junior employee on an private investements company did a serious, very critical mistake, that cost the company 1.000.000$. The man very sad, the next day went to his manager office and he handed his resignation. He said to him \\\"I know you probably going to fire me for the mistake I've done so I am quiting.\\\". And the manager said: \\\"Are you being serious? I just spend a million on your training. You aren't going anywhere!\\\".</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Loved this story too. Experience is so important.

You want your errors to be identical everywhere, to provide not too much information for your internal system but enough information to the debugger.</p>\\n<p>I am a REST fan and I hope you are too. What basically REST tell us, is to use <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">HTTP's error codes</a> for our API responses. E.g. when the user requests a particular row from our DB, using an identifier, and that row doesn't exists we should respond with a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">404 Not Found</code> status code.</p>\\n<p>Express.js has a <a href=\\\"http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">default error handler</a>. Basicaly it's just a middleware, with an extra argument, the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">err</code> argument.</p>\\n<p>On an Express.js request lifecycle, when an error occurs, we pass on to the next middleware with populated error variable, and the error handler triggers.</p>\\n<p>Let's start with that.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">router<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">use</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> next<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/* We log the error internaly */</span>\\n    logger<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">error</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/*\\n     * Remove Error's `stack` property.

Logging the error and proper displaying it. So I am logging it using a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/winstonjs/winston\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">logger</a> module and passing it to the user, using the error's status code. I have predefined those status codes so I don't have to deal with them every time. How? Let's see.</p>\\n<p>An error often consists of more than just an error code. We need a title, little more information and the stack trace on development environment. Instead of dealing with those information every time we create objects and only changing the bits we want each time. Here's a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Not Found</code> error object.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">exports</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">notFound</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> errorCode<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n  Error<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">captureStackTrace</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>message <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> message <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">||</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'The requested resource couldn\\\\'t be found'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>statusCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">404</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>errorCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> errorCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">||</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">404</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We are inheriting the Node.js <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Error</code> class and create a generic <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Not Found</code> error object we can use every time we need one.</p>\\n<p>So now we need to pass this to the Express.js error handler. So on an ordinary controller we do:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">app<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">use</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'/customers/:id'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> next<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> id <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">properSanitization</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>params<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n\\tsomeDBDriver<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">findOne</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>model<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    \\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span>model<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        \\t<span class=\\\"token function\\\">next</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">NotFound</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'Entity with id: '</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> id <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">' couldn\\\\'t be bound.'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">else</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        \\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/* ... */</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>So now the error handler will take place and do it's magic.</p>\\n<p>Often, in a more complex API will need more expressive status codes to express it's disfunctionalities. In that case, you can still respond with the proper status code but keep an internal error eode that makes sense on your application. So, in case a user tries to login with wrong credentials, send a 401 to the API consumer but keep an internal code, e.g. 4001 that means <strong>\\\"Wrong Username/Password\\\"</strong>. And that's what the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">errorCode</code> is.</p>\\n<p>Here's a simple <a href=\\\"http://github.com/kbariotis/throw.js\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">error collection</a> i've wrote, to save you the hassle.

I hope it inspires you too.</p>\\n<p>And here's the second.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A young junior employee on an private investements company did a serious, very critical mistake, that cost the company 1.000.000$. The man very sad, the next day went to his manager office and he handed his resignation. He said to him \\\"I know you probably going to fire me for the mistake I've done so I am quiting.\\\". And the manager said: \\\"Are you being serious? I just spend a million on your training. You aren't going anywhere!\\\".</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Loved this story too. Experience is so important. It's  what defines you as a professional. But in order to gain it you need to act. Without fear.</p>\\n<p>And again, these stories are not mine and if you happen to know the original authors please share them with me.</p>\\n<p>Do you know any good stories?</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"A few days ago I stumbled upon this wonderful  story .

You want your errors to be identical everywhere, to provide not too much information for your internal system but enough information to the debugger.</p>\\n<p>I am a REST fan and I hope you are too. What basically REST tell us, is to use <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">HTTP's error codes</a> for our API responses. E.g. when the user requests a particular row from our DB, using an identifier, and that row doesn't exists we should respond with a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">404 Not Found</code> status code.</p>\\n<p>Express.js has a <a href=\\\"http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">default error handler</a>. Basicaly it's just a middleware, with an extra argument, the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">err</code> argument.</p>\\n<p>On an Express.js request lifecycle, when an error occurs, we pass on to the next middleware with populated error variable, and the error handler triggers.</p>\\n<p>Let's start with that.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">router<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">use</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> next<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/* We log the error internaly */</span>\\n    logger<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">error</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/*\\n     * Remove Error's `stack` property.

Logging the error and proper displaying it. So I am logging it using a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/winstonjs/winston\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">logger</a> module and passing it to the user, using the error's status code. I have predefined those status codes so I don't have to deal with them every time. How? Let's see.</p>\\n<p>An error often consists of more than just an error code. We need a title, little more information and the stack trace on development environment. Instead of dealing with those information every time we create objects and only changing the bits we want each time. Here's a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Not Found</code> error object.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">exports</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">notFound</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> errorCode<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n  Error<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">captureStackTrace</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>message <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> message <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">||</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'The requested resource couldn\\\\'t be found'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>statusCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">404</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>errorCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> errorCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">||</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">404</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We are inheriting the Node.js <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Error</code> class and create a generic <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Not Found</code> error object we can use every time we need one.</p>\\n<p>So now we need to pass this to the Express.js error handler. So on an ordinary controller we do:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">app<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">use</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'/customers/:id'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> next<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> id <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">properSanitization</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>params<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n\\tsomeDBDriver<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">findOne</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>model<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    \\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span>model<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        \\t<span class=\\\"token function\\\">next</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">NotFound</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'Entity with id: '</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> id <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">' couldn\\\\'t be bound.'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">else</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        \\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/* ... */</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>So now the error handler will take place and do it's magic.</p>\\n<p>Often, in a more complex API will need more expressive status codes to express it's disfunctionalities. In that case, you can still respond with the proper status code but keep an internal error eode that makes sense on your application. So, in case a user tries to login with wrong credentials, send a 401 to the API consumer but keep an internal code, e.g. 4001 that means <strong>\\\"Wrong Username/Password\\\"</strong>. And that's what the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">errorCode</code> is.</p>\\n<p>Here's a simple <a href=\\\"http://github.com/kbariotis/throw.js\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">error collection</a> i've wrote, to save you the hassle.
