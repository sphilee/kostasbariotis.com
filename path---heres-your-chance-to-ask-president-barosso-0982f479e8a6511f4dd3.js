So complex that bugs out of nowhere jumped in.</p>\n<p>The latest bug i worked on all day today was that due to too many redirects, i was doing, on the same controller, Safari and it\'s \'<a title="Safari\'s 3rd party block cookies policy discussed" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14825805/cookies-not-setting-in-safari-6" target="_blank">Blocking 3rd Party Cookies</a>\' policy wouldn\'t allow to keep sessions, so i had to eliminate those redirects in order to create a persistent user experience.</p>\n<p>Some times too much simplicity can drive you crazy...</p>',excerpt:"I was called to create a Facebook Page Application to take part on contests, while an Admin panel was necessary to manage those contests…",frontmatter:{date:"September 02, 2013",path:"/simplicity-is-the-key-after-all/",tags:null,title:"Simplicity is the key after all...",draft:null}}},pathContext:{mainPostPath:"/heres-your-chance-to-ask-president-barosso/",nextPostPath:"/simplicity-is-the-key-after-all/"}}}});
